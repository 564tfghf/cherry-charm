## Assets

All the assets used in _Cherry Charm_ (3D models, textures, images, sound effects, music etc.) are either using Creative Commons / Public Domain or they were created by me and can be freely used for commercial purposes. The main factor for choosing and using them was the need to deliver a prototype in a short time. Some (or most) of them should be changed to more appropriate/professional ones for commercial releases of the product.
